# the Makefile system

We have two modes :

	- GNU make (called `gmake`), which use GNU make on Linux and BSD,
	- BSD make (called `make`), which use the native make of BSD systems.

These two versions of `make` are really different. With _BSD make_, you can get in a few lines what you get with _GNU
 automake_.
